Please be aware there may be delays and closures to our service throughout the month of April 2021. We apologise for the inconvenience. The book in form shall be removed when we can no longer accept repairs - if the book in form is missing, please check back at a later date.</p>            
                <p class="text-center"> We shall also be pivoting to support fewer makes and models of device going forward. This is due to added difficulty and cost in sourcing parts thanks to our leaving the EU, alongside an abnormally large workload. We shall continue to fully support Hadewe and Saeyang drills, servicing is still available on other devices but please be aware if any parts are needed from the original equipment manufacturer they may take weeks to months to arrive, and also be more expensive due to import taxes. </p>
                <p class="text-center">Please check back in a few days, we apologise for the inconvenience.</p>
