                <p class="text-center"> We no longer support devices over 6 years old - please check manufacture dates on the back of your unit before sending any device in. This is due to added difficulty and cost in sourcing parts thanks to our leaving the EU, alongside an abnormally large workload. We shall continue to fully support Hadewe and Saeyang drills, servicing is still available on other devices but please be aware if any parts are needed from the original equipment manufacturer they may take weeks to months to arrive, and also be more expensive due to import taxes. </p>
                <p class="text-center">International customers - please be aware that there may be excess charges and duties applied to return shipments which we cannot control. Devices are sent under a customs procedures code which should allow the device back through the border with no charges however through experience, it seems many countries and couriers ignore this. </p>
