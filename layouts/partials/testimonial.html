This is due to added difficulty and cost in sourcing parts thanks to our leaving the EU, alongside an abnormally large workload. We shall continue to fully support Hadewe and Saeyang drills, servicing is still available on other devices but please be aware if any parts are needed from the original equipment manufacturer they may take weeks to months to arrive, and also be more expensive due to import taxes. </p>
