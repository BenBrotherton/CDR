          <p class="text-center"> We no longer support devices manufactured before 2015 - please check manufacture dates on the
            back of your unit before sending any device in. This is due to added difficulty and cost in sourcing parts
            thanks to our leaving the EU, alongside an abnormally large workload. We shall continue to fully support
            Hadewe and Saeyang drills, servicing is still available on other devices but please be aware if any parts
            are needed from the original equipment manufacturer they may take weeks to months to arrive, and also be
            more expensive due to import taxes. </p>

                have had to increase our base servicing costs. Please see the table below for our base costs going
