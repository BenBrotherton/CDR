      <li>2.1 This Agreement shall commence from the date you book a repair and shall continue until we have repaired or
        otherwise returned your Device, whichever is sooner, and received any payment due from you.</li>

      <li>
        2.2 We shall make reasonable efforts to repair your Device subject to the availability of any parts required
        and/or the terms of any relevant guarantee or warranty. We shall perform the Service using our utmost care and
        skill.
      </li>

      <li>
        2.3 We shall use Genuine, OEM or High Quality compatible parts for the repairs of all Devices.
      </li>

      <li>
        2.4 Any time estimate for completion of the service, which may be given to you, is an estimate only and does not
        form any obligation under the terms of this Agreement. We will aim to return your Device as soon as reasonably
        possible, however, any repairs can be subject to further delays.
      </li>

      <li>
        2.5 We shall notify you when the Device has been repaired. If necessary, we shall send a reminder and the device
        will be recycled if not collected by day 90 to cover our costs.
      </li>

      <li>
        2.6 If we are unable to complete the Service for any reason, or the Service will incur further costs payable by
        you beyond that initially estimated by us, we will notify you immediately via telephone and/or email. If no
        fault is found on your Device or you do not accept our revised estimate, we will return your Device to you
        unrepaired and we reserve the right to charge you an inspection fee in accordance with our standard charges.
      </li>

        from time to time.

      <li>
        2.8 We shall be entitled to keep your Device until all charges payable have been paid. We may also charge an
        additional fee for storage of your Device.
      </li>

      <li>
        2.9 Use of our service may void your manufacturer’s warranty. If you would like to avoid this, then please take
        your Device directly to the manufacturer. Please note, your manufacturer’s warranty will not cover any
        accidental damage.
      </li>

      <li>
        2.10 Our products and repairs are covered by a blanket 3 month guarantee as standard starting at the date of
        invoice for the repair service. Failures of the device within this guarantee period are subject to assessment
        and further repairs may not be covered by the guarantee if the further fault does not coinside, or fall in the
        scope of the previous repair work completed.
      </li>

      <li>
        2.11 The Warranty is linked to a specific device as identified by its unique IMEI or serial number and to a
        specific Customer as identified by the records on our system. It will cover the Customer for any re-occurrence
        of the original fault and for the part replaced / repaired only, however if additional faults arise, they will
        not be covered under the terms of this Warranty.Furthermore, the Warranty will not cover accidental damage, nor
        will the cover extend should the device change ownership.
      </li>

      <li>
        2.12 We do not accept responsibility for any progression in damage where your Device has been repaired elsewhere
        prior to your repair at CDR or any issues found in your Device which were not evident upon initial inspection.
        Should any issues become evident, once the Device is opened, we will contact you via telephone/email.
      </li>

      <li>
        2.13 We do not accept responsibility for any progression in damage for Devices that have been damaged by liquid.
        Opening the Device could set off further damage which in some cases may be very serious and irreparable.
      </li>

      <li>
        2.14 We ask our Customers to monitor their device post repair, as unknown issues can arise soon after repair,
        which are beyond our control.

      <li>
        We do not take responsibility for any progression in damage for Devices that have been damaged by liquid.

        irreparable.
      </li>

      <li>
        We do not take responsibility for any progression in damage where your Device has been repaired elsewhere prior
        to your repair with us. Should any issues become evident, once the device is opened, we will contact you
        immediately via telephone/email.
      </li>

      <li>
        The warranty term included with your repair is detailed in 2.12 above. If the Device develops an additional
        fault unrelated to the original repair, the repair warranty contained in this paragraph will not apply. The
        warranty includes the repaired/replaced part(s) only and does not include further accidental or liquid damage to
        these parts. If your device is repaired by a 3rd party after our service, your warranty with CDR Chiropody Drill
