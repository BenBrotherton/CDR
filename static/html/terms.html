    <h2>Agreement for Repair</h2>

<p>1.1 The terms set out in these Conditions of Repair (“Agreement”) shall apply to the service (“Service”) we provide to repair your equipment and/or any accessories (“Device”) on the service check-in form.

1.2 Reference to “us”, “we” and “our” refer to TAFS Products LTD trading as CDR Chiropody Drill Repairs and references to “you” and “your” are references to you (“Customer), the person addressed on this form.
</p>

<h2>All repairs (unless otherwise stated)</h2>

<p>

2.1 This Agreement shall commence from the date you book a repair and shall continue until we have repaired or otherwise returned your Device, whichever is sooner, and received any payment due from you.

2.2 We shall make reasonable efforts to repair your Device subject to the availability of any parts required and/or the terms of any relevant guarantee or warranty. We shall perform the Service using our utmost care and skill.

2.3 We shall use Genuine, OEM or High Quality compatible parts for the repairs of all Devices.

2.4 Any time estimate for completion of the service, which may be given to you, is an estimate only and does not form any obligation under the terms of this Agreement. We will aim to return your Device as soon as reasonably possible, however, any repairs can be subject to further delays. 

2.5 We shall notify you when the Device has been repaired. If necessary, we shall send a reminder and the device will be recycled if not collected by day 90 to cover our costs.

2.6 If we are unable to complete the Service for any reason, or the Service will incur further costs payable by you beyond that initially estimated by us, we will notify you immediately via telephone and/or email. If no fault is found on your Device or you do not accept our revised estimate, we will return your Device to you unrepaired and we reserve the right to charge you an inspection fee in accordance with our standard charges.

2.7 The cost of repair will be calculated where possible in accordance with our standard charges as published from time to time.

2.8 We shall be entitled to keep your Device until all charges payable have been paid. We may also charge an additional fee for storage of your Device.

2.9 Use of our service may void your manufacturer’s warranty. If you would like to avoid this, then please take your Device directly to the manufacturer. Please note, your manufacturer’s warranty will not cover any accidental damage.

2.10 Our products and repairs are covered by a blanket 3 month guarantee as standard starting at the date of invoice for the repair service. Failures of the device within this guarantee period are subject to assessment and further repairs may not be covered by the guarantee if the further fault does not coinside, or fall in the scope of the previous repair work completed.

2.11 The Warranty is linked to a specific device as identified by its unique IMEI or serial number and to a specific Customer as identified by the records on our system. It will cover the Customer for any re-occurrence of the original fault and for the part replaced / repaired only, however if additional faults arise, they will not be covered under the terms of this Warranty.Furthermore, the Warranty will not cover accidental damage, nor will the cover extend should the device change ownership.

2.14 We do not accept responsibility for any progression in damage where your Device has been repaired elsewhere prior to your repair at CDR or any issues found in your Device which were not evident upon initial inspection. Should any issues become evident, once the Device is opened, we will contact you via telephone/email.

2.13 We do not accept responsibility for any progression in damage for Devices that have been damaged by liquid. Opening the Device could set off further damage which in some cases may be very serious and irreparable.

2.14 We ask our Customers to monitor their device post repair, as unknown issues can arise soon after repair, which are beyond our control.

<h2>
Summary Points
</h2>

<p>
Use of our repair service will void your manufacturer’s warranty.

Any data or information that you may have stored on the Device shall remain your sole responsibility and we accept no liability for loss or corruption of such data however caused and we therefore highly recommend that you back up your Device onto an external drive prior to your repair.

We do not take responsibility for any progression in damage for Devices that have been damaged by liquid. Although unlikely, opening the Device could set off further damage and in some cases may be very serious and irreparable.

We shall offer 1-month warranty for liquid damage repairs. Should your Device display any more issues relating to the liquid damage during this period, we will re-assess and re-quote for the work needed. We will also offer a full refund,excluding the £20 up-front cost, should you wish to take this option.

We do not take responsibility for any progression in damage where your Device has been repaired elsewhere prior to your repair at iSmash. Should any issues become evident, once the device is opened, we will contact you immediately via telephone/email. [Examples of this may include missing screens and torn flex cables.]

At all times we will do our utmost to deliver on the quoted turn-around time, but in some incidences, for reasons out of our control, this cannot always be guaranteed. Our quoted repair times start when the technician begins the repair.

If you use our Central Workshop repair service please make sure you read 3.7 above.

The warranty term included with your repair is detailed in 2.12 above. If the Device develops an additional fault unrelated to the original repair, the repair warranty contained in this paragraph will not apply. The warranty includes the repaired/replaced part(s) only and does not include further accidental or liquid damage to these parts. If your device is repaired by a 3rd party after our service, your warranty with iSmash will be voided
